## A powerful video by Clare Moody

Clare Moody, former MEP for South West and Gibraltar, opened Stroud4Europe's AGM with a talk on where we, as pro Europeans,  go from here.  Please listen to the short, inspiring video below. 

Clare's talk is prefaced by a tribute to Mark Huband who was a member of S4E's committee and died very sadly and very unexpectedly two days before the AGM.
