# Yet another loss

The ERASMUS scheme was set up in 1987 to foster links between schools, colleges, and universities across the 37 countries involved, mostly by funding and facilitating exchange visits. There are currently over 5,000 higher institutions participating in the Erasmus Program  and over 6 million students have been a part of it. Universities UK, the group representing British university leaders, calculates that Erasmus+ membership boosts the British economy by £243 million per year, after subtracting membership costs from the £420 million generated by EU students who visit the U.K. as part of the scheme. More than 17,000 U.K. students a year currently benefit from the scheme. [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-unlikely-to-participate-in-erasmus-post-brexit/)

The Prime Minister assured the House of Commons in January 2020 that the scheme would continue despite Brexit [PM Questions](https://universitybusiness.co.uk/international/there-is-no-threat-to-the-erasmus-scheme-johnson/) but has since gone back on his word and now says that the scheme is 'too expensive' and the government have proposed a much more limited scheme called the Turing Scheme. The [Independent] (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/erasmus-study-exchange-scheme-tuition-travel-b1814641.html) pointed out that it will not fund tuition or travel costs, and the living allowance has been slashed.

 A very good article at [Yorkshire Bylines](https://yorkshirebylines.co.uk/exiting-erasmus-is-an-avoidable-mistake/) provides some more background. It is clear that amongst the many drawbacks:

- living costs support much lower than Erasmus+
- no travel support (except students from disadvantaged backgrounds)
- no tuition fee support/waiver
- travel support an exact carbon copy of Erasmus+ rules - still calculated in km, not miles
- One direction only - no opportunities for students from other countries

## What might be done to reduce the harm?

Stroud4Europe are looking to see whether a local version of Erasmus could be created to reduce at least some of the damage being inflicted. We would like to hear from employers and other potential benefactors who may be interested in setting up/funding a suitable scheme. We would also like to hear from people who have benefited from the Erasmus scheme so that we can highlight these benefits.

## Write to your MP
Withdrawing from Erasmus was a government choice, as mentioned above, the PM originally gave assurances that this would not happen, and even as late as last December, the EU negotiators were hoping that the UK would continue to participate in the scheme. Our local MP should be asked why this decision has been made? Perhaps pointing out that, as well as the direct harm to our young people and others in education, the country will be worse off financially even if the expected running costs of the Turing scheme are lower than those of Erasmus because, as a one way only scheme, we will not be receiving the £243 million per year that Universities UK say that the Erasmus scheme brings in.
