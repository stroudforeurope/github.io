# introduction
 A very good article at [Yorkshire Bylines](https://yorkshirebylines.co.uk/exiting-erasmus-is-
an-avoidable-mistake/)

- living costs support lower than Erasmus+
- no travel support (except students from disadvantaged backgrounds) 
- no tuition fee support/waiver
- travel support an exact carbon copy of Erasmus+ rules - still calculated in km, not miles
- One direction only
