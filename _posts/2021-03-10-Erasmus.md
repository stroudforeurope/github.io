# Introduction

The ERASMUS scheme was set up in 1987 to foster links between schools, colleges, and universities across the 37 countries involved, mostly by funding and facilitating exchange visits. There are currently over 5,000 higher institutions participating in the Erasmus Program  and over 6 million students have been a part of it.

The Prime Minister assured the House of Commons in January 2020 that the scheme would continue despite Brexit [PM Questions](https://universitybusiness.co.uk/international/there-is-no-threat-to-the-erasmus-scheme-johnson/) but has since gone back on his word and now says that the scheme is 'too expensive' and the government have proposed a much more limited scheme called the Turing Scheme. The [Independent] (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/erasmus-study-exchange-scheme-tuition-travel-b1814641.html) pointed out that it will not fund tuition or travel costs, and the living allowance has been slashed.

 A very good article at [Yorkshire Bylines](https://yorkshirebylines.co.uk/exiting-erasmus-is-an-avoidable-mistake/) provides some more background. It is clear that amongst the many drawbacks:

- living costs support much lower than Erasmus+
- no travel support (except students from disadvantaged backgrounds)
- no tuition fee support/waiver
- travel support an exact carbon copy of Erasmus+ rules - still calculated in km, not miles
- One direction only - no opportunities for students from other countries
